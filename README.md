# weather-app

https://orluca.github.io/weather-app/
A simple weather app created with Vanilla JS and ChartJS.

### More Feature ideas:

- [ ] noch eine textbeschreibung des current weathers mit dabei packen?
- [ ] local time dazuf√ºgen?

### todos

- [ ] Moon symbols in the chart
- [ ] Refactor code again
- [ ] The isNight logic doesn't seem to work yet for locations that are very far up north
- [ ] Still need some kind of welcome/instruction on the search page, at least on first startup, so that it is clear that this is a weather app
