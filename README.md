# weather-app

A simple weather app created with Vanilla JS and ChartJS.

### More Feature ideas:

- [] Light/Dark mode toggle
- [] For the big overcast symbol it could be nicer to use a more 'sophisticated' image/symbol with some color instead of Font Awesome
- [] Temperature line changes color the hotter/colder it gets (from blue to violet/pink)
- [x] Create more column divisions for the app container, so that the forecast chart can be made a little bit bigger
